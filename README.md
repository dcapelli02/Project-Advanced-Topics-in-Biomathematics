# Advanced Topics in Biomathematics – Project

This repository contains the presentation and code developed for the course **Advanced Topics in Biomathematics**, held by Professor **Cinzia Soresina** at the **University of Trento** during the **Spring Semester of 2025**.

The project is based on the paper:  
**"Alzheimer’s Disease: A Mathematical Model for Onset and Progression"** by Bertsch, Franchi, Marcello, Tesi, and Tosin (2016).
